 Title: GPA Calculator Application Using Python
 Students: Yashas Donthi and Vibhav Simha
 
With the aim of creating a GPA calculator applicaiton, Python was the most appealing option for development due to its easy to use and versatile Tkinter module.
 
The application functionality was based on the following:
-Students can enter the marks obtained in each subject of a semester
-The number of subjects and the credits for each subject of a particular semester can be selected by the student
-The total number of semesters is set to 8
-After entering the marks obtained the student can calculate the SGPA(Of one semester) and CGPA(Cumulative of multiple semesters(if entered)) based on the following formula:
 SGPA=Summation of(((Marks obtained in a subject divided by 10)*Credits allocated for that subject)) divided by total number of credits of all subjects for a particular semester
 CGPA=Sum of SGPA of all semesters entered/Number of semester marks entered

Interactive layout implementing Buttons, DropDown Menus, InputBoxes and Textboxes has been created.
Implementation is done using various appropriate functions called after particular interactions. 
Module used-Tkinter
DataStructures- Dictionary, List

Possible Areas of Improvements/Additions:
-Aesthetics
-To be able to enter marks of subjects which are not out of 100 or to be able to set the maximum marks of each subject
-To be able to enter both internal test marks and the final semester exam marks and then Calculate CGPA/SGPA accordingly
-To make a student database storing the marks of each student across semesters and calculate CGPA/SGPA with login credentials
